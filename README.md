# About me
I am Daniel Fisch, a Theoretical Physicist and Economist who strives to actively contribute to the solution of the most relevant social problems. 
By providing tools, theories and models to understand the underlying dynamics, I aim to empower society to address the fundamental root causes in an effective and efficient way. 
More precisely, I intend to achieve this by combining economic analyses with methods from the physics of complex systems, network dynamics and stochastic processes which I have already applied in research about opinion dynamics at the University of Cambridge and about ride pooling at the Max Planck Institute for Dynamics and Self-Organization.\
If you are interested in what I am doing or want to discuss anything, please feel free to contact me: daf53 [at] cantab.ac.uk

**under constructions:** my previous work still needs to be transferred from my university account
